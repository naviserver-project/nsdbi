This is a shared library for the naviserver webserver which supports loadable
database drivers.

The simple Tcl interface handles pool connections etc. transparently.

Examples:

    foreach {x y z} [dbi rows {select x, y, z from table}] {
        append $page "x: $x, y: $y, z: $z \n"
    }


    dbi 1row {select x, y from table where z = 1}
    append $page "$x $y"


    dbi 0or1row {as above, query can return 0 or 1 row ...}


    set num_rows_effected [dbi dml {query which must be DML ...}]


    set x 1
    set y 2
    dbi rows {select * from table when x = :x and y = :y}


    set a(x) 1
    set a(y) 2
    dbi rows -bindarray $a -- {
        select * from table where x = :x and y = :y
    }


    
    dbi rows -bindset [ns_conn form] -- {
        select * from table where x = :x and y = :y
    }


    dbi rows -pool mypool {select ...}
