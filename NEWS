2008-06-10 nsdbi-0.2 released

* New 'template' and 'default' args to dbi_rows provide an easy way
  to build a formatted result efficiently. The new -append option
  provides an optimisation for ADP pages.

* New -max option to dbi_rows asserting the max number of rows
  expected. The default is a web-friendly 1000.

* dbi_0or1row now returns 1 when it finds a row, 0 otherwise.

* The options -bindarray and -bindset become simply -bind. The -pool
  option is now known as -db. The maxwait config option was renamed
  timeout.

* The interface for drivers has changed. Results are now fetched
  row-by-row, and value buffers are pre-sized for efficient fetching
  with a minimum of copies using the new Dbi_ColumnLengthProc callback.

* Some routines have been exposed for Tcl command writers: Dbi_TclGetPool,
  Dbi_TclGetHandle, Dbi_TclErrorResult.



2008-04-17 nsdbi-0.1 released

Initial release of a new database driver interface for NaviServer.
Features include:

* Native bind variables. All drivers support bind variables natively
  using a common syntax: select col from table where key = :variable

* Native, transparent prepared statements. Statements are prepared when
  first executed and cached for reuse in the future, which saves repeated
  parsing and planning.

* Automatic handle management. Handles are managed transparently, discouraging
  sloppy usage such as keeping handles from the pool, blocking other threads.

* Nested transactions with save points.

* Statistics on usage with dynamic configuration.
